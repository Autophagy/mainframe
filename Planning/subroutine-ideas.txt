The subroutines will be in the form of Warioware style minigames, with a timelimit (rendered as a trace) and if the minigame is failed, then the trace succeeds.

The subroutines are randomly chosen at the Corp set up, so you dont get the identical subroutines in a run. This means there need to be 8 unique subroutines (5 for the ICEs, 3 for the lives/retries on a failure). When you encounter an ICE, the subroutine is run via visual prompt of > SUBROUTINE_NAME, which will then show a screen saying:

> man SUBROUTINE_NAME

NAME
    SUBROUTINE_NAME

DESCRIPTION
    A brief tutorial on how the minigame works.

This stays on screen for a short time period (a few seconds), before the subroutine begins.
