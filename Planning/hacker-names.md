# HACKER NAMES

Hacker names are a little tricky to pin down. Unlike the corporation names, I wanted to try and have some kind of random generation going on for these. Hacker names tend to be 2 parters, like:

- Zero Cool
- Acid Burn
- Crash Override
- Dixie Flatline
- Puppet Master
- Laughing Man

In other media, like The Matrix (but also Gibson too), there is a tendency to go with 1 word names. Usually there's 3 or more syllables:

- Morpheus
- Trinity
- Maelcum
- Hideo

These tend to go for words with a bit more gravitas than the above 2 word names (like 'Burn' vs 'Morpheus'). So, we can preliminarily sketch out a framework for generating hacker names via 2 word banks. The first, dual word names, can be split into 2 types:

 - noun + noun // Zero Cool, Crash Override, etc
 - verb/adj + noun // Laughing Master, Crouching Tiger, Deadly Neon etc

The second word bank can just be single words, pulled from ancient literature perhaps.

When a name is generated, it could perhaps be randomly sprinkled with 1337 speak if its appropriate ('Neon' sometimes becoming 'N3on' or 'Ne0n').

As initial rules, I would generate: Noun + Noun names 50% of the time, Verb/Adj + Noun names 20% of the time and single noun names 30% of the time.
